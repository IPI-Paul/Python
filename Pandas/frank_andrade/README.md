[Python - Data Analysis with Python for Excel Users](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WcDaZ67TVRo)

## Course Work

This was an interesting tutorial, but really, I am more than happy with Excel and VBA is the light at the end of the tunnel in my everyday working life. I was not much impressed by Jupyter Notebooks and preferred to follow the whole tutorial using PyCharm only. However, I still found that Frank's introduction on the workings of Jupyter Notebooks was very helpful and showed that this was not just about writing code, but also about giving it a well designed and formatted layout.

This tutorial again offered me the chance to:

- turn each example in to a function/method.
- devise a way of using the import module function to display the code being used before displaying the results.
- learn more about how to get the desired results from a mix of lambdas and the map function.
- learn a lot on how to use the re module to make inputs more interactive.
