Keith's example , was the 1st I had seen in the use of Jupyter Notebooks. I was a bit worried that I might not be able to follow along, but only found a few operational differences when working with PyCharm:

- in PyCharm I had to issue a print statement with the Pandas dataframes.
- to keep a reminder trail of examples, I turned each example in to a function/method.
- created a while loop to enable an interactive approach to displaying each example.
