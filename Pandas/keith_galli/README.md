Keith's example , was the 1st I had seen in the use of Jupyter Notebooks. I was a bit worried that I might not be able to follow along, but only found a few operational differences when working with PyCharm:

- in PyCharm I had to issue a print statement with the Pandas dataframes.
- to keep a reminder trail of examples, I turned each example in to a function/method.
- created a while loop to enable an interactive approach to displaying each example.

## Course Work - Solving real world data science tasks with Python pandas

This course covers both pandas and matplotlib. I noted that some of the pandas syntax was different between my Windows set up and the tutorial, but luckily I figured it out. This time I used Visual Studio Code through out.

- I have built a Python app to track my tutorials much like zotero, but have not yet figured out how to get the right colours from ffpyplayer. So, when Keith was doing a blue plot I was seeing red :(.
- I have split the code from the tutorial in to various classes and realise that more thought would have to go into the charts class.
- Having scoured the internet, I have also added annotations to the charts (Yay!).
- For example 4, I added a scatter plot and with the annotations feel that it is a good use case.
- I have also used pyqt5 to build a GUI and display all charts,  both as an object using matplotlib FigureCanvasQTAgg and as an embedded image in a pyqt5 web engine.
