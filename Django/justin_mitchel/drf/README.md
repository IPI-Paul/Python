# Build a Django REST API with the Django Rest Framework - Complete Tutorial

[Full Course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c708Nf0cHrs).

# Course Work

 - Learned how to use a requirements text file to install dependencies.
 - The first time I followed along with the tutorials I simply commented out code that was no longer being used.
 - I then watched another tutorial where I learned to create interactive web page views and felt that the course work I had done here did not give me a good structure to go back to and reference in future.
 - So I started the course from scratch and created new Apps with every change.
 - Due to name clashes and other errors thrown up, I used a naming structure for all url patterns and app models. With additions to serializers to dynamically retrieve the detail view names for Hyperlinked Identity Fields.
 - Unfortunately, with JSON Web Authentication Tokens I was not able to dynamically change the default authentication token type and have made a note to the user to change it when testing jwt.py.
 - Unfortunately, in order not to access the internet whilst doing the course, part of the course relating to axios was not followed.
 - Adding an index page that listed the Apps created and the many functions was challenging, but gladly not impossible.
 - I used static files to provide css and javascript to the index page and its popups.
 - I also used a static json file to populate links and descriptions to both the index page and the py_client scripts.
