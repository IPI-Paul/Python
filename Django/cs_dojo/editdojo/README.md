# Course Work

 - I watched a Django course prior to these tutorials with more course material and found that I understood more of what was being taught in these tutorials.
 - I gained more insight into working with Django and used that to add an index app to list all the Apps created by each tutorial.
 - I had not yet learned how to pull in the css from the static folder because there was no examples of the Django admin or Django page views. So I loaded the css script with the view and dumped it into the page.
 - Although I have done a lot of Python tutorials, I have never really gained an understanding of calling the Python debugger in scripts.
 - The brief example of using the Python debugger led me to do more web searches on its uses and helped me resolve issues on the previous course I had to redo.
 - These courses also introduced me to pipenv. With the previous 2 Django courses I had used a virtual environment created by PyCharm for another course I had taken and was not really aware of how it all came together.
 - I then went back to the previous 2 courses and converted them to use pipenv instead.
