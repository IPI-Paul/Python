## Course Work - Complete Python Data Science Tutoria

Keith's example , was the 1st I had seen in the use of Jupyter Notebooks. I was a bit worried that I might not be able to follow along, but only found a few operational differences when working with PyCharm:

- in PyCharm I had to issue a print statement with the Pandas dataframes.
- to keep a reminder trail of examples, I turned each example in to a function/method.
- created a while loop to enable an interactive approach to displaying each example.

## Course Work - matplotlib Data Viz

When looking into how Python displays charts, I found this course very helpful and informative. Keith does not over complicate things and gives good points on how to use the matplotlib web site as a coding reference guide.

- I have used pyqt5 to display all charts as either objects or web page embedded images.
- Although the library offers a quick way to visualise your data, the course does not confirm/cover whether tooltips are available.
- I would expect at some point being asked to provide tooltips in whatever charts I produce. So that would be a big plus if matplotlib has that available.
- Keiths explanation of real life scenarios also helps.
