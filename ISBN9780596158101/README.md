Moving on to learn a more advanced Python I found Mark Lutz's work very intuitive and easy to follow. Admittedly some examples took days to achieve, such as trying to avoid web exposure whilst learning a new language and being a complete novice. Thanks to other Github members and their work, i was able to modify their POP3, SMTP and NNTP servers to interact with the clients taught in this book.

I like Python!
