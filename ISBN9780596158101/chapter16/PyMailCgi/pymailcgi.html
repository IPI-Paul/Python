                    This site implements a simple web-browser interface to 
                    POP/SMTP email accounts. Anyone can send email with this 
                    interface, but for security reasons, you cannot view email 
                    unless you install the scripts with your own email account 
                    information, in your own server account directory. PyMailCGI 
                    is implemented as a number of Python-coded CGI scripts that 
                    run on a server machine (not your loacl computer), and 
                    generate HTML to interact with the client/browser. See the 
                    book <i>Programming Python, 4th Edition</i> for more details.

                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <p>
                    Caveats: PyMailCgi 1.0 was initially written during a 2-hour 
                    layover at Chicago's O'Hare airport. This release is not 
                    nearly as fast or complete as PyMailGUI (e.g., each click 
                    requires an Internet transaction, there is no save operation 
                    or multithreadin, and there is no caching of email headers 
                    or already-viewed messages). On the other hand, PyMailCgi 
                    runs on any web browser, whether you have Python (and Tk) 
                    installed on your machine or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also note that if you use these scripts to read your own 
                    email, PyMailCgi does not guarantee security for your 
                    account password. See the notes in the View action page as 
                    well as the book for more information on security policies.

                    <i><u>New in Version 2</u></i>: PyMailCGI now supports 
                    viewing and sending Email attachments for a single user, and 
                    avoids some of the prior version's exhaustive mail downloads. 
                    It only fetches message headers for the list page, and only 
                    downloads the full text of the single message selected for 
                    viewing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><u>New in Version 3</u></i>: PyMailCGI now runs on 
                    Python 3.x (only) and employs many of the new features of 
                    the mailtools package: decoding and encoding of 
                    Internationlized headers, decoding of main mail text, and so 
                    on. Due to regression in Python 3.1's cgi and email support, 
                    version 3.0 does nbot support sending of binary or 
                    incompatibly-encoded text attachments, though attachments on 
                    fetched mail can always be viewed (see Chapter 15 and 16).
